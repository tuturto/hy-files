Introduction
============

Welcome to hy-files. This book explores some aspect of a exciting new language
called Hy, which is a dialect of Lisp [#f1]_. What makes Hy somewhat different
is that the language is *embedded* inside other language, Python. This allows
routines written in Hy call code written in Python and vice-versa.

A challenge with programming books is that while books is usually read
sequentially, learning isn't sequential. There's all kinds of paths, loops and
detours through the subject. Some may be faster than others, while some are
more useful than others. Concepts in programming relate to each other and form
a web where almost everything is connected with everything in a manner or
another. This books tries to present a path through subject of programming in
Hy. While it covers substantial amount of matter, even more matter had to be
left out. Otherwise this book would have been an unwieldy tome that was never
finished. Sometimes it refers to concepts that will be covered later in
detail, but I have tried to keep that in minimum.

Source code for this book is publicly available at

.. [#f1] Lisp is a whole family of languages, originating from the 1950s. 
         Modern variants include such languages as Clojure, LFE and Racket.
